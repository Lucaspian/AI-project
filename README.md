The finance and accounting data is crucial for a company, stockholders, and
investors. It is the best way to observe the performance of a company. We can
observe four aspects through those data: Debt solvency indicator, Operational
capability, Profitability, and the primary inspection of development capability
indicators. Those are the best measurements of the performance of a company.
This project is an excellent chance to understand how those finance figures affect a firm. This project aims to build an artificial intelligence neural network
model to supervise the learning data set so that it can predict which companies
will go bankrupt and which financial indicators will affect the company.
